## Writing and saving Touch Develop scripts

**This repo contains the source code of the Touch Develop editor.** If you are
intending to write Touch Develop scripts, you want to go to the web app at
`touchdevelop.com`:
* **stable:** https://www.touchdevelop.com/app/
* **beta:** https://www.touchdevelop.com/app/beta
* **latest:** https://www.touchdevelop.com/app/latest

You can save a Touch Develop script from the web app by clicking the `Save` button on
the script's home page. This will create a JSON file that you can save. You can later
drag-and-drop that file into the web app (running locally or via the web site) to load
the script again.

## What's in this repo?

The repo is mostly written in [TypeScript](http://www.typescriptlang.org/) with tiny pieces
of HTML gluing.

This repo contains the source code for:
* the browser client
 * the compiler
 * the editor
 * the runtime
* the node.js client

The cloud backend for Touch Develop is available in
[TouchDevelop-backend repo](https://github.com/microsoft/touchdevelop-backend).
It was originally written in Touch Develop itself (see [script tdlite](https://www.touchdevelop.com/aycxg)
if you're interested) and was later converted to TypeScript.
It is currently used for the [BBC micro:bit](https://www.microbit.co.uk)
as well as https://www.touchdevelop.com.

## Contributing

There are many ways to [contribute](https://github.com/Microsoft/TouchDevelop/blob/master/CONTRIBUTING.md) to Touch Develop.

* [submit bugs](https://github.com/Microsoft/TouchDevelop/issues) and help us verify fixes as they are checked in.
* review the [source code changes](https://github.com/Microsoft/TouchDevelop/pulls)
* [contribute bug fixes or features](https://github.com/Microsoft/TouchDevelop/blob/master/CONTRIBUTING.md).

If you're not a developer but still would like to help, we've got more tasks for you!

* [help translate the user interface](https://touchdeveloptranslator.azurewebsites.net): do you use Touch Develop and speak a foreign language? You can help!

## Setup

In order to build Touch Develop, ensure that you have [Git](http://git-scm.com/downloads) and [Node.js](http://nodejs.org/) installed.

* clone a copy of the repo:

````
git clone https://github.com/Microsoft/TouchDevelop.git
````

* change to the Touch Develop directory:

````
cd TouchDevelop
````

* install dependencies:

````
npm install jake -g
npm install tsd@next -g
tsd reinstall
npm install
````

## Building

There's different ways to build and run Touch Develop:

* just build:

````
jake
````

You can generate source maps by defining the env variable ``TD_SOURCE_MAPS``

````
export TD_SOURCE_MAPS=1 # optional, will slow down your build
````

* build and run locally:

````
jake local
````

* run the test suite

````
jake test
````

* cleaning

````
jake clean
````

### Arduino compilation on Windows
These steps install the tools for Windows (+ extras to handle the Arduino compilation scenarios)
* install [Chocolatey](https://chocolatey.org/)
* install nodejs, Visual Studio Code
````
choco install -y nodejs git visualstudiocode arduino python2 pip
````

## Editing

You can use your favorite editor to edit the TypeScript file. Here are a couple tips:

* [Visual Studio Code](https://code.visualstudio.com/), cross platform editor for TypeScript. Simply open the folder in Code.
* Atom: there are a number of packages that will give you TypeScript coloring

## Documentation

All the docs are available online at
[https://www.touchdevelop.com/docs](https://www.touchdevelop.com/docs).

The docs are authored as Touch Develop scripts in Touch Develop itself. You can
fork them and send pull requests from Touch Develop itself to update them.

## More handy commands

Our catch-all tool is `build/client.js`, which is compiled from
`tools/client.ts`. Some of the common invocations of `client.js` are
exposed as Jake targets.

    # assumes TD_UPLOAD_KEY and TD_UPLOAD_USER are set, uploads a new test build
    jake upload

Find out about other commands directly:

    node build/client.js

The `client.js` is built by default.

## The various directories in the tree

* `ast`: contains the lexer, parser, type-checker and ast definitions for the
  Touch Develop language
* `browser`: feature-detection
* `editor`: the Touch Develop user interface that drives the website: hub, script
  list, editor itself
* `generated`: files needed for the build that are re-generated manually once in
  a while
* `intellitrain`:
* `json`:
* `lib`: the libraries exposed to Touch Develop scripts, written in TypeScript
* `libcordova`: Apache Cordova specific implementations
* `libnode`: Node.JS specific implementations
* `libwinRT`: (deprecated) WinRT specific implementations
* `mc`: Minecraft bindings
* `noderunner`: runs in the cloud, and parses Touch Develop scripts / compiles
  them by responding to requests on `/api`.
* `node-webkit`: configuration files for the node-webkit app creation
* `officemix`: office mix app host
* `rt`: various run-time support libraries for the Touch Develop application:
  in-browser storage, cloud connection, promises, DOM utilities...
* `runner`: the run-time system for *generated* Touch Develop apps; that is, once
  a Touch Develop script is packaged as an app (webapp, cordova app, etc.),
  `runner.js` is the runtime system and the stub is in `webapp`
* `shell`: shell app used by Azure and node-webkit; basically a way to serve
  files locally
* `storage`: code for syncing your locally-stored scripts and the cloud storage,
  in the Touch Develop application
* `tools`: internal tools that are part of the build (pre-processing)
* `webapp`: the stub file that is used to generate the HTML5 Web App when
  exporting a script
* `www`: the base files that make up the Touch Develop website (html and css)

### Structure of the generated website / app

When packaged, as the website or as an app, the directory structure is flat.
That is, the CSS and HTML files from `www/` as well as the generated `.js` files
from `build/` all end up in the same directory. That way, `index.html` can refer
to `main.js` without worrying.

When running locally (via `jake local`), the local node server knows where to find
the right files to give the illusion that all files are in the `/editor/local/`
directory of the web server.
